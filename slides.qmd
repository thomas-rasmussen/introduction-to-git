## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS)

- Version control system: Software that tracks different versions of files

- Distributed: There is no central repository; each copy of the codebase contains the
  entire history of versions of files.^[See accompaning notes for more details]

::: {.notes}
Just a very brief explaination. We might get back to the "distributed" part later. If not,
there is (probably) some more in-depth details about this in the notes.

## Why bother?

Why not just make copies of files and save in another folder?

- More rigorous than making folders with old versions of code.

- Makes it easy to switch back and forth between different versions of files

- Makes it easy to see precise differences in different versions of code

- Enhances collaboration on code by multiple persons

## TODO

  - Why bother? Current practices with "old" folders and proper structure is good enough?
  - Using Git Bash. Just do it. Powershell would technically be an alternative. All git commands
    would work but you would (probably) not be able to do other kinds of basic commands that is
    not Git?
  - Setup/configuration of Git? git config stuff? Using Git Bash
  - Basic Git usage. Introduce commands with running example?
  - The three stages
  - More technical command
  - Running example that is live coded to show off introduced concepts?
  - Basic exercises playing around with the basic commands


## Part II

- Part II: Using git in day to day work
  - Simple ways of using Git in projects
  - Initialize a repository in an existing directory
  - Branching
  - Exercises meant to illustrate a simple but good workflow

## Part III

Probably not time for this, but some of it will probably come up in discussions
anyway, maybe there is time to talk about some of it

- Part III: Advanced use
  - Advanced commands. Like reset, rebase, diff etc
  - remotes
  - GitHub
  - aliases. can/should maybe be included in part I
  - Collaboration on a codebase
  - Distributed workflows / Git flow / whatever something about having a plan on how to do things.
  - Why use specifically Git? Are there any alternatives? See eg Pro Git chapter 1
  - Git GUI/IDE's. What are popular choices. Pro's and con's over using only Git Bash. Specifically
    Git versus Subversion.
  - Version controlling output. Can it be justified in practice? Always better to only version-control code?
  - What to do when you royally fuck up? Talk about minimizing deleting code using remotes and proper
    work flows.
